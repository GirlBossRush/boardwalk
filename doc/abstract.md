# Boardwalk
### *An interactive social canvas.*

Boardwalk is a personal website framework built to encourage vanity.
Users can create their own board to fill with blog posts, photos, and other customizable widgets. 
The layout is free form and custom to each user; the only limitation is the size of the board.
Boardwalk is created using Ruby on Rails as the backend and Backbone.js as the client side framework.
The project uses MongoDB, a non-relational database, to store user data.
It is my goal to have boardwalk in a usable state as defined by the README file. 
Boardwalk is in production and can be used at [Boardwalk.io](http://boardwalk.com).
