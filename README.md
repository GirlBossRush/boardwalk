# Boardwalk
#### *Ego driven design*
Boardwalk is a personal website framework built to encourage vanity. Users can create there own page to fill with blog posts, photos, and other customizable widgets. The layout is free form and custom to each user. The only limitation is that widgets must snap to grid points; this ensures some level of clarity.

# Requirements
