# Boardwalk
### *By Eric Wright*
Boardwalk is a personal website framework built to encourage vanity. Users will have there own page to fill with blog posts, photos, and other customizable widgets. The layout is free form and custom to each user. The only limitation is that widgets must snap to grid points; this ensures some level of clarity.

# Vision
The goal is to create a tool that allows users to show off and have a place on the web that is all about themselves. The user is the most important person in the world on Boardwalk. Everyone wants to know about what they're doing and who they are doing it with. Each "Boardwalk" will have four neighboring users in each cardinal direction. Users can have unlimited friends but only four neighbors. The neighbors are the most important people in the user's life. A girlfriend, best friend, co-worker; all possible neighbor material. Eventually a graph can be made illustrating the interconnected nodes, inviting users to travel across Boardwalks to find like-minded individuals.

# Implementation
Boardwalk will use a non-relational database and client side Model-View-Controller framework. Ruby on Rails will be used to act as a database front end, running validations against input. Rails will have no concept of view logic; it's only task is to validate input. The client will do most of the heavy lifting. Having views generated on the server and the client is very difficult to manage. The project will much far more scalable too because we are only concerned with data input.

# Proposal
I plan to create Boardwalk and have it usable by the end of the Spring 2013 semester. I have my concerns on promising production ready code but I am confident that the project will be in a usable state. It is my goal to learn as much about client side MVC and non-relational databases with this project.
